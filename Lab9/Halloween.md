# Exploratory Analysis of Halloween Candy

## 1. Importing candy data

``` r
candy_file <- "candy-data.csv"

candy <- read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

``` r
nrow(candy)
```

    [1] 85

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

``` r
sum(candy$fruity)
```

    [1] 38

## 2. What is your favorate candy?

``` r
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
```

    [1] 81.64291

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s
> winpercent value?

My favorite candy is “Haribo Sour Bears”.

``` r
candy["Haribo Sour Bears", ]$winpercent
```

    [1] 51.41243

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

``` r
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

    [1] 76.7686

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

``` r

Let’s use the skim() function in the skimr package that can help give us
a quick overview of the candy dataset.

``` r
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale
> to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

winpercent

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the
> candy\$chocolate column?

I think it indicates the presence or not of chocolate in that candy.

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

``` r
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(candy, aes(winpercent)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=10)
```

![](Halloween_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

It is not.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

It’s below 50%.

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit
> candy?

``` r
choc.inds <- as.logical(candy$chocolate)
fruit.inds <- as.logical(candy$fruity)
choc.win <- candy[choc.inds, "winpercent"]
fruit.win <- candy[fruit.inds, "winpercent"]

mean(choc.win) > mean(fruit.win)
```

    [1] TRUE

On average, chocolate candy is higher ranked than fruity candy.

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

``` r
t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
```


        Welch Two Sample t-test

    data:  choc.win and fruit.win
    t = 6.2582, df = 68.882, p-value = 2.871e-08
    alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
    95 percent confidence interval:
     11.44563 22.15795
    sample estimates:
    mean of x mean of y 
     60.92153  44.11974 

It is, since the p-value is very small

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

``` r
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col(fill = "gray")
```

> sorted by winpercent?

``` r
ggplot(candy) +

  geom_col(fill = "gray")
```

![](Halloween_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)

### Time to add some useful color

Let’s setup a color vector (that signifies candy type) that we can then
use for some future plots. We start by making a vector of all black
values (one for each candy). Then we overwrite chocolate (for chocolate
candy), brown (for candy bars) and red (for fruity candy) values.

``` r
my_cols <- rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

And make a colored bar plot

``` r
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) 
```

![](Halloween_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)

Now, for the first time, using this plot we can answer questions like:

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst

## 4. Taking a look at pricepercent

``` r
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)
```

    Warning: ggrepel: 54 unlabeled data points (too many overlaps). Consider
    increasing max.overlaps

![](Halloween_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for
> the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese’s Miniatures

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and
> of these which is the least popular?

``` r
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

                             pricepercent winpercent
    Nik L Nip                       0.976   22.44534
    Nestle Smarties                 0.976   37.88719
    Ring pop                        0.965   35.29076
    Hershey's Krackel               0.918   62.28448
    Hershey's Milk Chocolate        0.918   56.49050

Nik L Nip is the least popular within the 5 most expensive candies.

> Q21. Make a barplot again with geom_col() this time using pricepercent
> and then improve this step by step, first ordering the x-axis by value
> and finally making a so called “dot chat” or “lollipop” chart by
> swapping geom_col() for geom_point() + geom_segment()

``` r
# Make a lollipop chart of pricepercent
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(pricepercent, reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent)) +
  geom_segment(aes(yend = reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent), 
                   xend = 0), col="gray40") +
    geom_point()
```

## 5. Exploring the correlation structure

``` r
library(corrplot)
```

    corrplot 0.92 loaded

``` r
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

![](Halloween_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png)

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated
> (i.e. have minus values)?

chocolate vs fuity  
bar vs pluribus

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

chocolate with bar, pricepercent and winpercent

## 6. Principal Component Analysis

``` r
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

    Importance of components:
                              PC1    PC2    PC3     PC4    PC5     PC6     PC7
    Standard deviation     2.0788 1.1378 1.1092 1.07533 0.9518 0.81923 0.81530
    Proportion of Variance 0.3601 0.1079 0.1025 0.09636 0.0755 0.05593 0.05539
    Cumulative Proportion  0.3601 0.4680 0.5705 0.66688 0.7424 0.79830 0.85369
                               PC8     PC9    PC10    PC11    PC12
    Standard deviation     0.74530 0.67824 0.62349 0.43974 0.39760
    Proportion of Variance 0.04629 0.03833 0.03239 0.01611 0.01317
    Cumulative Proportion  0.89998 0.93832 0.97071 0.98683 1.00000

Now we can plot our main PCA score plot of PC1 vs PC2

``` r
plot(pca$x[,1:2])
```

![](Halloween_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)

We can change the plotting character and add some color:

``` r
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```

![](Halloween_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png)

We can make a much nicer plot with the ggplot2 package but it is
important to note that ggplot works best when you supply an input
data.frame that includes a separate column for each of the aesthetics
you would like displayed in your final plot. To accomplish this we make
a new data.frame here that contains our PCA results with all the rest of
our candy data. We will then use this for making plots below

``` r
# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])

p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p
```

![](Halloween_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png)

Again we can use the ggrepel package and the function
ggrepel::geom_text_repel() to label up the plot with non overlapping
candy names like. We will also add a title and subtitle like so:

``` r
p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```

    Warning: ggrepel: 43 unlabeled data points (too many overlaps). Consider
    increasing max.overlaps

To have more candy labels we can change the max.overlaps value to allow
more overlapping labels or pass the ggplot object p to plotly like so to
generate an interactive plot that you can mouse over to see labels:

``` r
# library(plotly)

# ggplotly(p)
```

Let’s finish by taking a quick look at PCA our loadings. Do these make
sense to you? Notice the opposite effects of chocolate and fruity and
the similar effects of chocolate and bar (i.e. we already know they are
correlated).

``` r
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```

Fruity, hard and pluribus. It makes sense since they seem to be
positively correlated with each other.
