# 1: Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

## PDB statistics

First let's see what is in the PDB database - the main repository of protein structure.

Downloaded composition stats from: https://www.rcsb.org/stats/summary

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("PDBstats.csv", row.names = 1)
stats
```

There is a problem here due to commas in the numbers. This causes R to treat them as characters.

```{r}
rm.comma <- function(x) {
  as.numeric(gsub(",","",x))
}
```

```{r}
rm.comma(stats$EM)
```

I can use `apply()` to fix the whole table

```{r}
pdbstats <- apply(stats, 2, rm.comma)
rownames(pdbstats) <- rownames(stats)
pdbstats
```

```{r}
totals <-  apply(pdbstats, 2, sum)
totals
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
round(totals/totals["Total"] * 100, 2)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(pdbstats[,"Total"]/ sum(pdbstats[,"Total"]) * 100, 2)
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

Skipped.

Protein structures in PDB as a fraction of UniProt sequences.
See: https://www.uniprot.org/help/release-statistics

```{r}
round((pdbstats[1, "Total"]/251600768)*100,2)
```

# 2. Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Resolution of the structure is 2 A, hydrogen is smaller so only oxygen is visible.

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

Water HOH 308

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

Here is a lovely figure of HIV-Pr with the cathalitic ASP residues, the MK1 compound and all the important water 308

## The bio3d package for structural bioinformatics

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

# Predicting functional motions of a single structure

Let's finish today with a bioinformatics calculation to predict the functional motions of a PDB structure.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
plot(m)
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
